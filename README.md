In the video above, you can click on it to get a look in how the code that I implemented into my project works and how it was able to turn out the way it is in present time.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I am quite proud of my ability to use github simoltaneously with visual studio code and commit changes efficiently using such a method. I feel like I was able to greatly improve my github skills as I am now able to use it well to the best of my abilities which I wasnt able to do in the start of this college year. I commited enough times that I needed as most of the work was done on visual studio code and I made sure a good amount of code was done before I commited and I only did this when I was sure that the code worked well and there were no erros shown.

Another thing that I was very proud of in my assignment was my ability 

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
